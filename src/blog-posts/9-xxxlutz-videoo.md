---


In the early stages of developing Kyma, the focus of Kyma to extend and customize enterprise applications using serverless computing or microservice architecture and the fact that Kyma uses existing open source technologies raised interest among companies.

Innovative companies are constantly seeking to identify and experience new technology solutions to assess potential benefits for the company. Receiving feedback from companies early on is very valuable for the Kyma team to make improvements before general availability.

Before going Open Source with Project Kyma, it was pre-launched to a selected group of companies. The XXXLutz KG was one of the companies to get early access to Kyma and test it.

Christian Renner, Chief Technology Officer XXXLutz Gruppe, one of the world&#39;s largest furniture retailers, shared why they wanted to test Kyma and what their experience was like.

Getting feedback and contributions from the Open Source community remains our focus moving forward. We invite you to start your very own Kyma journey!

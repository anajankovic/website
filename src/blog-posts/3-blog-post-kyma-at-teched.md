[SAP TechEd](https://events.sap.com/teched/en/home) is the premier SAP technology conference, which takes place every year on 3 continents and is an excellent source of news on the technical and platform offerings of SAP. In 2018 it&#39;s scheduled in Las Vegas, Barcelona and Bangalore. Being used in a number of implementation projects and also being the basis for the upcoming SAP Cloud Platform Extension Factory lab preview – it was important to ensure that we have Kyma ambassadors on each of those events, who can answer questions and generally serve as a contact point on-site for people to reach to.

- For [Las Vegas (02-05.Oct)](http://events.sap.com/teched-2018-usa/en/home), that&#39;s: myself ([@evilyeti](https://twitter.com/evilyeti)), Gopi Kannappan ([@gopikannappan](https://twitter.com/gopikannappan)) and Hisar Balik. You can find us around the SAP Cloud Platform booths as well as at the few C/4 HANA sessions we have on the agenda.
- [For Barcelona (23-25.Oct)](http://events.sap.com/teched-2018-emea/en/home) this will include: Marco Dorn ([@mado0803](https://twitter.com/mado0803)), Stanimir Ivanov ([@s1vanov](https://twitter.com/s1vanov)) and Lukasz Szymik ([@lszymik](https://twitter.com/lszymik)). They&#39;ll run the same C/4 HANA sessions there and also hang around the CP

- Last but not least – in [Bangalore (25-30.Nov)](http://events.sap.com/teched-2018-india/en/home) we have: Johannes Engelke ([@quablab](https://twitter.com/quablab)) and Sayan Hazra there on-site, who will educate people about Kyma, Extensibility and Serverless functions.

We're super excited to see the Kyma story growing and more ideas coming onboard. Feel encouraged to reach out and talk to us about Kyma, software extensibility or any ideas you might have around those things! You never know – we might have some stickers at hand at that very moment.

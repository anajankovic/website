title: "The Core Special Interest Group"

As you know, a vibrant community of individuals stands behind the Kyma open-source project. They collaborate through Special Interest Groups (SIGs) and Working Groups (WGs), just like it is done in Kubernetes. Additionally, both SIGs and WGs facilitate technical discussions, proposals, and contributions. They also ensure Kyma is a welcoming community for all contributors. The WGs facilitate discussions and work on short-lived, specific topics that either result from the work of SIG groups or that the community members initiate directly.

**Is there a SIG I can join?**

Yes, there is one main SIG called **Core** that is the entry point. The Core SIG consists of SIG leaders and members. To learn more about their roles, click [here](https://github.com/kyma-project/community/blob/master/sig-and-wg/README.md#roles).

**Who are the Core SIG leaders?**

The Core SIG leaders are Piotr Kopczynski ([@PK85](https://twitter.com/PiotrasPk)), Mateusz Szostok [(@mszostok](https://twitter.com/m_szostok)), Ahmed Abdalla ([@Abd4llA](https://twitter.com/Abd4llA)), and Lukasz Gornicki ([@derberg](https://twitter.com/derberq)).

**What is the purpose of the CORE SIG?**

The purpose of the CORE SIG is to:

- Publicly represent Kyma
- Facilitate the collaboration with external contributors
- Communicate the Kyma project vision and roadmap to the community
- Represent the Kyma contributors
- Be the main contribution contact for Kyma
- Gauge interest, request the community feedback, and ensures it is addressed
- Own all code repositories in the Kyma organization except for the community repository
- Showcase proposals to the community and collects the feedback to those proposals to assist the decision-making process
- Represent its members and the Kyma community in the Council meetings

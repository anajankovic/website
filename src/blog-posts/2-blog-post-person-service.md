Now that Kyma is out there available to the world you are most probably keen on testing and implementing your own scenarios leveraging Kyma. Well, we are happy to introduce you to [A sample Application based on Spring Boot showing the features of Kyma](https://github.com/kyma-incubator/examples/tree/master/personservice) to get you started as a developer.

This hands-on guide provides an end to end example application implementation in Java / Spring Boot running on Kyma. In the end state, you as a developer will understand all the features Kyma delivers. In a quick summary, this guide teaches you how to:

- Deploy the application to local Kyma (based on minikube) or ´real´ Kyma cluster 
- Connect your service to Kyma as Extension Platform and run a scenario
- Extend business applications with Kyma through event driven Lambda (serverless) functions
- Bind your Application to a brokered Backing Service
- Add Authentication and Authorization
- Leverage Kubernetes Self-Healing
- Use tracing and logging support

We also ask you to join the Kyma community on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/kymaproject), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/kyma-project/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/kyma-project).

Have fun with Kyma!

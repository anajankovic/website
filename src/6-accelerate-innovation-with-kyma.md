&quot;Is Tesla a car or a mobile device with apps?&quot; This might sound like a silly question as we usually consider a car is primarily made up of things like an engine, metal bodywork, tires and so on.  But Tesla revolutionized the car industry through software innovation. Its ability to update software over-the-air and bring new features and functionalities is the key factor in attracting consumers to buy Tesla cars. This revolution shows that innovations, even in industries as old as car manufacturing, are an important and necessary way of penetrating the market faster. Many of the leading car manufacturers are still trying to catch up with Tesla&#39;s success. Businesses need to leverage new technologies, take on innovations and must transform digitally to be competitive. Simply put - innovate or perish!

Therefore, companies that leverage technology to create competitive advantage will win.

On our ongoing innovation journey, we have identified several challenges for companies that go through this process of digital transformation:

- **Heterogeneous Product Portfolio:** Single vendor solutions are something of the past. (ref: https://www.thoughtworks.com/de/insights/blog/implications-tech-stack-complexity-executives). Companies don&#39;t want to invest in a single vendor product stack. They need to have best of breed products. Heterogeneity, is unavoidable, so software product companies need to be ready to embrace the diversity and be open to work side by side with the dreaded competition.

- **Monolithic deployment:** Monolithic applications can be great options but as the size grows, so does the complexity. This slows down the time to market, adds complexity to testing and shipping, complicates adding new features or extensions, makes scaling difficult, and so on. Currently many of the best available products are still monolithic.

- **Cloud Native:** Companies are moving faster towards using cloud-native open source stacks for production (ref: https://www.cncf.io/blog/2018/08/29/cncf-survey-use-of-cloud-native-technologies-in-production-has-grown-over-200-percent/). Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) describes cloud native any software that is container-packaged, dynamically orchestrated and managed, and microservice-architected. Building cloud native is not easy. It requires better inter service communication, proper traceability of transaction across solutions, logging across several services and solutions, monitoring and operating 100s of services and so on.

- **Need for Speed:** Some of our customers say, &quot;Speed is the new ultimate currency&quot;. It&#39;s challenging to develop at a faster pace while facing the challenges of heterogeneity, monolithic deployment and the need to make every developer in the organization a cloud-native developer.

Kyma has worked hard to overcome these challenges and support businesses throughout their digital transformation journey. Kyma is an open-source project designed natively on Kubernetes. It allows you to extend and customize cloud-based and on-premise enterprise applications in a quick and modern way, using serverless computing and microservice architecture.

This way, Kyma enables businesses to:

- **Be open and extendable:** Its openness allows you to plug and play any service that adheres to open service broker API specification providing a catalog of reusable, integrated services for developers, both in-house and 3rd party services. This provides the possibility to bring business services and technical backing services from different vendor to extend your existing applications.

- **Be seamlessly connected:** Simplified approach to have secure connectivity between systems allows seamless API and event integration of the existing applications. It is possible to manage and orchestrate existing applications to build common extension solution even in heterogenous landscapes. Additionally, there is one connection with multiple possibilities.

- **Use any programming language:** It allows developers to develop microservices or serverless functions using any programming language of choice, thus allowing companies to have more options at hiring developers.

- **Bring speed and agility:** Businesses don&#39;t have to wait for months or years to deliver specific scenarios or use cases, with Kyma these can be delivered faster (within days or weeks) and costs less.

- **To accelerate innovation:** In many cases innovation starts as a test or a trail. In such cases, both speed and low cost are of great importance. Kyma enables businesses to start working on their solutions immediately instead of finding the right technology and integration options first. Kyma brings the startup culture to enterprises.

Kyma is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/kyma-project) and open for developers to contribute to Kyma&#39;s development. It allows businesses to build and advance products and services they offer to make them even better on the marketplace. This empowers companies to stand out, to increase revenue, and to be more like Tesla.
